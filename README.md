# How to handle permission pop-ups in Real Devices on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-nodejs-webdriver-permissions) using the Appium & NodeJS Webdriver.io framework

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid, you may face a scenario where you would like to automatically handle permission pop-ups. You may choose to either accept all permission pop-ups or dismiss all of them. You can handle the case as mentioned below separately for Android or iOS apps. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-nodejs-webdriverio).

# Steps:

The following is an example on how to handle permissions in the capabilities in the automation script.

Below is the ```android-single.conf.js``` example shown:

```js
exports.config = {
  user: process.env.LT_USERNAME || "YOUR_USERNAME",
  key: process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY || "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
  updateJob: false,
  specs: ["./../specs/android-test.js"],
  exclude: [],
  capabilities: [
    {
      build: "NodeJS WebDriverIO Android",
      name: "Sample Test - WebDriverIO",
      isRealMobile: true,
      platformName: "Android",
      deviceName: "Galaxy S9",
      platformVersion: "10",
      app: "lt://", //Set your APP URL

      //GRANT PERMISSIONS FOR ANDROID
      autoGrantPermissions: true,

      //ACCEPT ALERTS FOR IOS
      autoAcceptAlerts : true,

      //DISMISS ALERTS FOR IOS
      autoDismissAlerts : false,
      
    },
  ],
  logLevel: "info",
  coloredLogs: true,
  screenshotPath: "./errorShots/",
  baseUrl: "",
  waitforTimeout: 10000,
  connectionRetryTimeout: 90000,
  connectionRetryCount: 3,
  path: "/wd/hub",
  hostname: "mobile-hub.lambdatest.com",
  port: 80,
  framework: "mocha",
  mochaOpts: {
    ui: "bdd",
    timeout: 20000,
  },
};
```

## Executing The Tests

```bash
npm run single
```

Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
node ios.js
```

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
